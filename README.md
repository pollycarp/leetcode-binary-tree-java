# Binary Tree Solutions – Java

This repository contains four classic binary tree algorithms implemented in Java. Each problem includes a reusable `TreeNode` class, a well-commented solution, and a `main()` test harness with sample cases.

## 📂 Problems Covered

1. ✅ **Same Tree**
   - Check if two binary trees are structurally identical and have the same values.

2. ✅ **Symmetric Tree**
   - Check whether a binary tree is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

3. ✅ **Balanced Binary Tree**
   - Determine if a binary tree is height-balanced.

4. ✅ **Invert Binary Tree**
   - Invert a binary tree by swapping left and right children recursively.

## 🧪 How to Run

Compile and run the program using any Java IDE or CLI.

```bash
javac BinaryTreeSolutions.java
java BinaryTreeSolutions
```

## 📎 Sample Output

```
Same Tree: true
Symmetric Tree: true
Balanced Tree: true
Before invert (root.left.val): 2
After invert (root.left.val): 3
```
